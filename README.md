Nobody will give you a bot which works out of the box. Every strategy will go to zero (alpha)

**Meme-coin super cycle bot**

### 1. Find high-potential tokens early

### 2. Make a top 3-5 per bot and determine the **strategy**

**YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST LEARN TO USE AND COME UP WITH YOUR OWN STRATEGY**

These are examples since you are new:

- Liquidation strategy for meme coins
    
    Example:
    
    - When there are over 10 million dollars in long liquidations, i will buy my list from step 1
    - When there are over 10 million dollars in short liquidations, i will liquidate
- Mean-reversion strategy for meme coins
    - Use hyperliquid to short memes like wif and popcat when there are huge moves upward and we see signs of a pullback
    - Use this strategy in combination with trending strategy
- Trending strategy for meme coins
    - use some sort of ‘sma’ to determine when the market is trending and be in position when it is and out of position when it is not
    - Potentially Use liquid strategy for an entry and give it X time in order to get over sma, if it doesn’t in X time, close. If it does, hold the trender
- Consolidation strategy
    - Market maker type strategy where you are looking at supply and demand zones. since the market is going sideways, you will buy demand zones (little lower than resistance zones) and sell supply zones.

### 3. Ensure a great exit strategy

**Most will get rekt because of super cycle thesis this bullrun.**

Focus on the exit, there will be HUGE signs we can get off volumes, price away from MAs, twitter sentiment and more.

- If cycle 2 (starting now) doesn’t make a move quickly, **do not hold positions in the bot**. You might justify it, your bot won’t. listen to the bot
- Focus on the close inside your bot
